Open the HW4_CoppeliaSim_File.ttt file with CoppeliaSim to run the script. HW4_PythonCode.py is the related python code.

We have implemented D* algorithm in CoppeliaSim using example code from github and scale it into [-2.5, 2.5] space. The goal of this project is to find path form start point to goal point using D* algorithm. The obstacles were created in a separte scene and copied it from there, so that it was loaded before runing the simulation. Safety boundary was used to avoid collision.
