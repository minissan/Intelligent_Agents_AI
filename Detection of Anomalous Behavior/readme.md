In this study, we present machine learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from different scenarios using Coppeliasim and developed an anomaly detection system using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an Autoencoder. Our system was evaluated in two contexts, with results showing that the LR model consistently demonstrated superior performance in both contexts, while the Autoencoder model showed promise as an alternative in Context 2. This research highlights the potential of machine learning techniques, specifically autoencoders, in detecting anomalous behavior and improving the security and reliability of robotic systems.
