Open the Quadcopter Patrol.ttt file with CoppeliaSim to run the script

The quadcopter in this file can patrol the target area without revealing its strategy to intruders. The target area is given as 6m X 5m. I have written the script in Python. The random number generator generates random number within the the target area range, i.e., for X: -3,3 & for Y: -2.5,2.5. The script use these 2 random number to generate the random target. The quadcopter then follow that target. After quadcopter reaching the target, the script generates new target location for the quadcopter. The quadcopter again follow the new target. I have used while loop to continue this action.
